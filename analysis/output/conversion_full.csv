Cast highlight. Romeo Torres as Cleon, Lysimachus, Third Knight, and Second Pirate. Quote: ""The challenge of creating four distinct characters, some with much more text to work through than others-- unreal. The ask at each rehearsal is to be both your most intelligent and most idiotic."" 
Cast highlight. Abril L√≥pez as Thaisa and Diana. Quote: ""We are really taking sea la vie to a whole new level."" 
Cast highlight. Stefania Gonzalez as Understudy for Pericles and others. Quote: ""In a rehearsal room filled with laughter and play and grief and groundedness, it's easy to find answers to 'Why live a life?'""

This infographic just scratches the surface of the discussions we‚Äôve had about race in the play so that we can be our joyful, HIDiotic selves‚Ä¶without making racism a joke. Thank you so much to Farah Karim Cooper for her incredible book #TheGreatWhiteBard which we consider essential reading for the modern Shakespeare artist!

2024-07-16T13:36:26+0000,"In Waiting Room Z, Shakespeare‚Äôs most often forgotten characters find themselves antsy, excited, and lost. It is here that the all-knowing Stage Manager sends them out into the world. However, it‚Äôs been years since these characters have been in the spotlight, and they‚Äôre beginning to grow impatient. Hamlet Isn't Dead's ""When My Cue Comes"" is a devised play that follows four of these ‚Äúleft-behind‚Äù characters in the canon and their desperate attempts to do whatever it takes to take their place on stage once again.

Helmed by @b.carty23 and devised and performed by @aaronanthonymoore @reidywatson @ladymaudlin @nataliedeboer.actor and @gabrielcethridge we are thrilled to bring this new production to @frigidnewyork 's Little Shakespeare Festival!

#Pericles #HamletIsntDead #Hidiots #Shakespeare

Text reads: Hamlet Isn't Dead's Pericles. Why no boys allowed? Quote from Tina Packer's book, Women of Will: ""It has taken hundreds of years for women‚Äôs voices to be heard and affect the course of human events. In order for the world to find its healthy balance, all women‚Äôs voices need to be heard."" End quote. Text continues: We have taken that sentiment and included all marginalized genders, not just women, in this reimagining of Pericles. Hamlet Isn't Dead has a long history of non-male interpretations, like in the 2017 production of Henry the fifth, the 2018 production of As You Like It, and the 2019 production of Troilus and Cressida. Quote from Olivia Basile, who plays Pericles, ""When you're someone in a body or a gender that is marginalized, you're never thinking Pericles is you. The rehearsal process has been a really safe space to engage with a text that I don't think I'd engage with otherwise."" End quote. Quote from Jillian Cicalese, Assistant Director, ""We‚Äôre exploring a story that is traditionally told with cis men using a better representation of today's artists and discovering how the text translates through those voices. To me, this piece is about finding power in femininity and the relationship between daughter and father. The feminine spirit through the character of Marina brings her father back to life after years of estrangement, trials, and tribulations."" End quote. Quote from Sophia Carlin, Director, ‚ÄúThe things that happen to Pericles, the loss of his wife, child, and general uncertainty of where to call home, can happen to anyone. Because we have a focus on centering marginalized voices in this production, their perspectives on these characters are upheld above anything else. My hope is that this process has become a very safe space but also a very soft space in that it is informed by the experiences and needs of the people we've chosen to collaborate with.‚Äù End Quote.",3.0,2130,93.0,https://scontent-lga3-3.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/463369246_557178133658299_385240364412777647_n.heic?stp=dst-jpg_e35_tt6&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&efg=eyJlZmdfdGFnIjoiQ0FST1VTRUxfSVRFTS5iZXN0X2ltYWdlX3VybGdlbi5DMyJ9&_nc_ohc=SAzGuZybLWYQ7kNvwEmGM_u&_nc_oc=Adn3K8ZC-G9F6d7jYVI1cubSN_8413ltLolqcz674PFIrOxCh0zEHJ1m6EgQx_pFuDDQzp_RIjNTMO0en-U46iTK&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-3.cdninstagram.com&edm=AM6HXa8EAAAA&_nc_gid=UX7N9kGiqNNdGFe8DDb9yQ&oh=00_AfcSN5FFLQXyDl3MREnrZ_W0DA4cgx4a8aiPgoKz88UGrw&oe=68FF0D88,https://www.instagram.com/p/DBL6rhovFvu/,0.0014084507042253522
